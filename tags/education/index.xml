      <description>Update | September 25, 2017
This essay was originally published on Carleton&amp;rsquo;s Learning Log three years ago to this day. I wanted to revisit it to give it some long-overdue polishing and clarification.
 There has always been a subtle tension between the students studying science, technology and mathematics and those studying the arts. This slight friction seems to begin around the time that students fresh out of high school enter university and old friends you have seen every day in class for the past four years all of sudden have an entirely different schedule from yours, and the discussions begin on how the subject you are studying is superior to everyone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
