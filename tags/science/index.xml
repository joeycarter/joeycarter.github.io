      <description>This essay was originally published on Carleton&amp;rsquo;s Learning Log on September 25, 2014, three years ago to this day. I wanted to revisit it to give it some long-overdue polishing and clarification.
There has always been a subtle tension between the students studying science, technology and mathematics and those studying the arts. This slight friction seems to begin around the time that students fresh out of high school enter university and old friends you have seen every day in class for the past four years all of sudden have an entirely different schedule from yours, and the discussions begin on how the subject you are studying is superior to everyone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

Grad school is rough.
I had no illusions that it would be any other way when I signed away the next five years of my life to the University of Toronto last spring to study particle physics. I knew it would be hard work. I knew that I would regularly be burning the midnight oil to finish assignments, scrambling to make plots for a presentation the next morning, fighting with LaTeX to format that godforsaken bibliography in the style ordained by the council of physics elders eons ago, and all the other grunt work that goes along with a life in academia.</description>
